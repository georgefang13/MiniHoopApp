# S.W.I.S.H. Basketball Mini-Hoop Auto Rebounder

Welcome to the MiniHoopApp repository! This project is part of the S.W.I.S.H. Basketball system, designed to enhance the experience of playing mini basketball. The app serves as the user interface for tracking and visualizing player performance, including shot data and heatmaps.

## Features
* Player Profiles: View performance statistics for each player.
* Shot Performance Tracking: Displays total shots, successful makes, and shooting percentages.
* Heatmaps: Visual representation of shot locations and success rates.
Responsive Web Interface: A clean and user-friendly interface designed for desktop and mobile devices.
## How It Works
* Sensors Integration: Data is collected from the S.W.I.S.H. Basketball system using a variety of sensors that detect shots and record data such as shot success and ball color.
* Data Processing: Shot data is processed and stored in a backend database (to be integrated).
* Visualization: The MiniHoopApp retrieves the processed data and presents it in a dynamic, interactive UI.
